On May 13th 2021, I presented my PhD thesis titled "Optimization of craniosynostosis surgery:  virtual planning, intraoperative 3D photography and surgical navigation" at [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/Inicio).

This thesis was done in collaboration with [Hospital Gregorio Marañón](https://www.comunidad.madrid/hospital/gregoriomaranon/) (Madrid, Spain) and [Children's National Hospital](https://childrensnational.org/) (Washington, DC, United States).

I would like to thank everyone involved in this project. Especially, my supervisor **Prof. Javier Pascau** and **Dr. Santiago Ochandiano**.
